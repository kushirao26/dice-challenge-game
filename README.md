# dice-challenge-game
The Dice Challenge Game is a fun two-player game where each player rolls a dice. The player with the higher number wins. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it features random dice generation, score display, and a simple UI. It helps practice DOM manipulation and logic.
Each time the page is refreshed, both players roll a virtual dice. The game uses JavaScript to generate random numbers between 1 and 6 for each player. Based on the outcome, the game dynamically updates the dice images and displays the winner or a draw message.

The user interface is clean, minimal, and responsive, offering a smooth experience across devices. The logic is simple but helps reinforce key programming concepts like conditional statements, image manipulation, and DOM updates. The project does not require any external libraries or frameworks, keeping the codebase lightweight and beginner-friendly. This game can be further expanded by adding animations, sound effects, or score tracking. Overall, itâ€™s a great mini-project to sharpen basic JavaScript and web design skills.
